we start with 445, and we find that we have access as Guest to the share "Profiles$"
in the profiles share, there are around 200 empty dirs, named after users
i copied it all from the terminal into libreoffice calc, and made myself a clean usernames.txt file, then i had to run impacket-getNPUsers with that wordlist i generated, and i wouldve found the hash for the user 'support', which is crackable with john.
then i had to run bloodhound-python with the credentials i just got, and i wouldve found out that the user support has the privileges to reset the password for the user 'svc_backup', and i can do that using rpcclient, this will lead me to a foothold as the backup user, which is also a part of the backup operators group, now i can use this [script](https://github.com/G4sp4rCS/backup-operator-to-domain-admin-POC)to make my life easier, it automates the collection of the registry hives and ntds.dit file, so all i have to do is download it to my host using Evil-WinRM, and parse all the files using impacket-secretsdump, now i have the NTLM hash for the DA 'Administrator', and im able to get a privileged session using impacket-wmiexec
