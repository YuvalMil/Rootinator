this wasnt a simple box, but i was somewhat close - i failed with 2 parts
1.  realizing i should check for app.py with my LFI
2. being able to write a python script to bruteforce the aes encryption 
writing the python script is just beyond me right now, not much i can do about it.
not finding the app.py file is a big miss, i already found config.py and db.json, i knew this was a python webapp, not trying app.py is a shame, i did try burp important files list, but for some reason it doesnt contain app.py
