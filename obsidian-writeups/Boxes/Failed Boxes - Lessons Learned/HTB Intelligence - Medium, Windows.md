failed for a few reasons, but the box wasnt very hard, just my inexperience
1. i failed with the web section, i identified the right vulnerability, and i exploited it well, it was an IDOR vuln, all the pdf files on the website had the same name format to them in the documents dir, it was "YEAR-MONTH-DAY-upload.pdf"
and i used FFUF to find all the links, and checked the pdf's manually to find something interesting, but i messed up and made the 'days' wordlist a single digit instead of always 2 digits ( i did 1, 2 ,3 instead of 01, 02, 03) so that made me miss the only important PDF that contained the password for new accounts
2. failed with abusing the powershell script - i knew what i should do to proceed, i saw that the script tries to authenticate to a certain dynamic location with the 'Ted' user that i needed for privesc, but i had no idea how to control the dynamic parameter, i didnt even understand that this script is checking DNS records with the keyword 'web' so i used ChatGPT to do this part
3.  failed to understand the meaning of constrained delegation so didnt manage to get domain admin - i thought constrained delegation allows a service to impersonate as the user it can delegate to, thats wrong - constrained delegation means it can impersonate as ANY user, to the specific service its trusted to delegate to, meaning that in this case, delegation to WWW/dc.intelligence.htb means i can easily get domain admin access, as WWW is any common web service.
