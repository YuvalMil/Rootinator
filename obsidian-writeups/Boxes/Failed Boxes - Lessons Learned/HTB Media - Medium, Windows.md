this one was hard for me... i started pretty well with having the right idea, but ultimately i didnt manage to do anything on this box

1. gaining a foothold with the NTLM leak - i knew that its a strong possibility, and tried to look for something like it on google, but only found unrelated garbage, only after checking the answer i managed to find some details about NTLM hash leak with windows media player files. next time when im looking for something that might not exist, first confirm it does indeed exist, and then start looking for POC's, looking for POC's right off the bat just confused the search.
2. lateral movement to a system user - few problems here, first i didnt even consider moving to a system user, i checked for local users and saw that there are no other users enabled, and figured my route is probably from the current user, straight to administrator, and this approach is just bad. Next thing i did wrong was just assuming that the apache server service is running by my user, thats why i never thought about trying to upload a webshell, i thought that would just execute commands as the user i already compromised, which is really dumb, i couldve easily tried to check ownership for the directory and figure out that its not the case, for example, a simple `get-acl * ` wouldve revealed the actual user that runs apache
