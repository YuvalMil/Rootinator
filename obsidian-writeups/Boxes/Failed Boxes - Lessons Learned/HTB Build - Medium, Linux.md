not a simple box, was missing a great deal of skills to pwn it successfully.
the biggest challenge here was the pivoting, i had some practice with pivoting between hosts, but pivoting between containers is different.
also the services running on the box are unusual, need to read more about such services if its the first time i meet them. for example rsh / PowerDNS / rexec
reading the official writeup again can be beneficial
